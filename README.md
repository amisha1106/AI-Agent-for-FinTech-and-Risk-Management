# AI Agent for FinTech and Risk Management

## Overview
This project develops an AI-powered agent designed to assist in financial risk management by forecasting market volatility, optimizing portfolios, detecting fraudulent activities, and providing real-time risk monitoring. The system leverages advanced machine learning and deep learning models combined with interactive visualization tools to deliver actionable financial insights.

## Key Features
- **Volatility Forecasting:** Hybrid LSTM and GARCH models predict short-term and long-term market volatility.
- **Portfolio Optimization:** Uses XGBoost for return prediction and Markowitz Optimization for optimal asset allocation.
- **Fraud Detection:** Employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Isolation Forest, and Autoencoders to detect anomalous trading patterns.
- **Real-Time Risk Dashboard:** Interactive dashboard displaying volatility trends, risk scores, and trade alerts using Dash and WebSockets.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to extend support for multiple asset classes, including forex, cryptocurrencies, and commodities.

## Technologies Used
